			<strong>PAIELLA GROUP - (Boston, MA) - Research Assistant (Sept 2013 – PRESENT)</strong><br />                                                                                                     
			Project: Plasmonic Meta-Surface directional light emitters and sensors.<br />
			As part of my PhD research, I design and fabricate meta-surfaces tailored to enable directional sensing and directional beaming of light. The goal of this research is to combine these directional sensors to build an ultra-thin, flat lens-less cameras, based on the compound eye vision modality. Cameras based on this technology have superior capabilities including infinite depth of view, wide viewing angle and ability for polarized vision. I do all the design and fabrication including Finite Domain Time Difference optical numerical simulations, Nano-lithography and experimental verification of prototypes. To ease my testing, I write custom LABVIEW programs to automate data collection and allow communication between different types of equipment in from different manufacturers. I also write custom scripts in MATLAB and Lumerical software to automate data processing. With this, I have automated almost every step of my data acquisition and processing making it less prone to measurement error and freeing my time to enable parallel running of different tasks I may have. In addition to my research, I upgraded the group website completely changing the design to a more open, easily accessible form by coding in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I currently still maintain the website.<br />                                                                                                     
			<strong>SCHLUMBERGER-DOLL RESEARCH - (Cambridge, MA) - Research Associate (August 2012 – Present)</strong><br />                                                                                                       
			Project: High-temperature High-pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) flow sensing.<br />
			As part of the Physics group at SDR, I built and tested a prototype circuit board for downhole well sensing tools. With iterative testing and redesign I was able to shortening the settling time and lower circuit noise which is critical for accurate collection of the weak signals associated with the downhole environment. I did PCB circuit board design, assembled a prototype (including soldering, wiring and programming of microcontrollers). As part of this project, I also designed and built a high temperature, high pressure test setup appropriate to simulate real oil rig downhole environment for the devices.<br />
		
			<strong>LONCAR LAB. FOR NANO-SCALE OPTICS - (Cambridge, MA) - Research Assistant (June 2010 – May 2012)</strong><br />  
			Project: Silicon Photonic Crystal ultra-high resolution micro-spectrometer.<br />
			As part of my research in reconfiguration of optical Nano-Cavities for applications in on chip spectroscopy, under guidance of Prof. Loncar and Dr. Parag I developed a prototype functional micro-spectrometer. Using silicon photonic crystals and micro-heaters, this spectrometer was able to recover a spectroscopic spectrum of a standard gas cell with comparable spectral resolution to a conventional bench top high resolution spectrometer, despite being more than 1000 times smaller in dimension. I did the fabrication, packaging (including wire bonding) and testing of the working device.<br />

			<strong>BOSTON UNIVERSITY - (Boston, MA) – Optical Processing Facility Lab Assistant(August 2017 – Present)</strong><br /> 
			As the assistant cleanroom manager, I trained new users for various pieces of equipment in the clean-room, helped maintain equipment in good running condition and also helped troubleshoot whenever other cleanroom users had problems running their processes. In this role I also initiated upgrading of common computers and also improved acess to documents by initiating an network drive folder with soft compies of documents that would be available to cleanroom users as long as they could log into the Boston University network. <br />
